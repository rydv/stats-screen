Documentation for process.py:

Purpose: The process.py script is the main entry point for processing rule sheets and finding matches based on various rule types.

Key Components:

RuleParams (from rule_params.py): Defines the structure for rule parameters.
Field (from field.py): Represents individual fields in the rule sheet.
BaseRule (from base_rule.py): Abstract base class for all rule types.
ExpRule (from expression_rule.py): Handles expression-based rules.
PerfRefRule (from perf_ref_rule.py): Handles perfect reference rules.
ValdtRule (from value_date_rule.py): Handles value date rules.
Main Function: process_rules(file)

Input:

file: A dictionary containing file metadata, including the uploaded file name.
Process: a. File Handling:

Constructs the file path using the uploaded file name.
Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
b. Rule Parsing:

Iterates through each row in the DataFrame.
For each row, creates a RuleParams object with rule metadata.
Creates Field objects for each reference field in the row.
c. Rule Type Identification:

Determines the rule type based on the fields' flags (perf_ref_flag, valdt_flag, op_flag).
Creates the appropriate Rule object (PerfRefRule, ValdtRule, or ExpRule) based on the identified type.
d. Rule Processing:

Calls the find_matches() method on each Rule object.
Collects the results in a list of DataFrames.
e. Result Aggregation:

Concatenates all result DataFrames.
Performs final processing (sorting, deduplication).
Generates a summary of matches for each rule.
Output:

A dictionary containing:
status: Boolean indicating success or failure.
output: Contains the matches DataFrame and run summary.
error_details: Any error information if the process failed.
Helper Functions:

validate_rule(rule): Validates individual rules.
identify_rule_type(fields): Determines the rule type based on field flags.
valdt_type_check(fields): Checks if any field has a value date flag.
operation_type_check(fields): Checks if any field has an operation flag.
Flow:

The script reads the input CSV file.
For each row, it creates Rule objects based on the rule type.
It processes each rule to find matches.
Finally, it aggregates all matches and generates a summary report.
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the process.py script, detailing its purpose, components, main function, helper functions, and overall flow in the context of the rule processing system.
