Hi Team,

Following our discussion yesterday regarding one-to-many and many-to-many cases, I've analyzed the requirements and potential solutions within our current program structure. I'd like to share some insights and request additional information:

Our current logic is not limited to one-to-one cases. It can handle scenarios that require up to two filters per rule, including some many-to-many cases.

For requirements involving more than two filters, we would need to update our application architecture.

To proceed effectively, I need to analyze some actual many-to-many rules from real-world scenarios.

Action Item: Could you please help collect related information from users about their specific many-to-many rule requirements? This will allow me to brainstorm and develop a comprehensive solution that addresses all use cases.

Once I have this information, I'll be able to propose a tailored solution that meets our users' needs while optimizing our application architecture.

Thank you for your assistance in gathering this crucial information.

Best regards, [Your Name]
