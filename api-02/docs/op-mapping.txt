great, moving forward, we will create a mapping for each operation, basically we will map the same id operations so that we can instantiate the respective strategy, 
we need to iterate through filters and their all ref fields, 
if id is not present in the mapping, 
- we will create a key, identify strategy type using the flags, create an entry for that field
{
'<id>': {
'op_type': 'expression_st',
'filters': {
    'filter-1': {
        'ls_flag': <that filter ls flag>,
        'dc_flag': <that filter dc flag>
        'fields': [field1, ... so on]},
    'filter-2': {}
} }
}

if id is none, we generate a custom id, and all none ids for that particular op_type will come under same this custom id,
In this way will create a mapping
