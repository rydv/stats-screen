The rule processing engine handles validation and matching of transactions based on rule definitions provided in CSV/Excel format.

Key components:

Rule Sheet Structure:
Common fields: rule_id, category_code, set_id, or_and_flag, value_date_flag, amount_flag
Filter fields: ls_flag, dc_flag
Reference fields: ref1-ref4, string1-string30 containing pattern matching expressions
Rule Processing Flow:
Rules are parsed using RuleBuilder
Each rule can have multiple filters (legs)
Fields are parsed using Field class to extract operations and patterns
Rule type is identified based on field flags (PerfRef, ValueDate, Expression etc.)
Appropriate rule strategy is applied to find matching transactions
Pattern Matching:
Supports various identifiers like |EXACT|, |EXP|, |FRMT|, |OP|, |PerfRef|
Regular expressions are generated for pattern matching
Values can be extracted and compared between filters
Validation:
Rule parameters are validated
Field values and patterns are validated
Transactions are filtered and matched based on rule criteria
The engine provides a flexible framework for defining and processing complex matching rules while maintaining extensibility through strategy pattern implementation.
